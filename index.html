            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles,(UCLA) currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Quantitative Economics. I have a strong passion for data analysis and its real-world applications, particularly in economics, healthcare, and finance. My academic background in econometrics and machine learning has equipped me with the skills to analyze large datasets and extract meaningful insights that help drive informed decision-making. I enjoy working with data to solve complex problems, whether it's predicting economic trends, improving healthcare systems, or enhancing business strategies.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an avid basketball player, and I value maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle. I believe that sports help develop discipline, teamwork, and resilience, qualities that complement my academic and professional growth. My curiosity drives me to constantly learn and grow, and I am always looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge in new and challenging contexts. Driven to excel in quantitative analysis and data-driven decision-making, I aspire to build a impactful career at the intersection of economics, and data science.</p>

          <strong>House Price Estimation Using Regression Analysis in Python</strong>
          (Oct 2024 – Nov 2024)<br>
          I did this project in my first quarter at UCLA as part of the Econometrics and Python course. In this project, I use advanced Regression Techniques to predict the final price
          of homes on the basis of variety features. The motivation behind this is to apply econometric techniques and machine learning to understand how
  different factors influence house prices and improve the accuracy of price predictions. The factors used to predict the overall price of the house are- Overall Quality, Year Built, Garage Area, Above ground living area in square feet, Lot Area
 in square feet and Number of fireplaces in the house.This type
  of analysis is crucial for a real estate market as it helps buyers, sellers, and policy makers make
  informed decisions.

            <strong>Efficiency Analysis of National Innovation Systems in APO Nations</strong>
            (Jan 2024 – April 2024)<br>
            I conducted an efficiency analysis of National Innovation Systems (NIS) in Asia-Pacific Observatory (APO) nations using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) framework. The analysis compared inputs like Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD), RD exports as a percentage of GDP, and journal articles. By applying a two-stage DEA approach, I evaluated both intermediate and final outputs to assess the relative efficiency of NIS across APO nations. The findings provide insights that can inform targeted interventions to improve innovation policies and strategies, supporting sustainable economic growth and technological progress.

            <strong>Voluntary Carbon Credits, Carbon Trading and Carbon Pricing</strong>
            (Sep 2023 – Dec 2023)<br>
            I analyzed the role of carbon trading and voluntary carbon credits (VCCs) in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. VCCs enable individuals, businesses, and governments to voluntarily reduce their carbon footprint, supporting activities such as afforestation campaigns and renewable energy projects that eliminate or reduce emissions. On the other hand, carbon trading is a regulated market mechanism where businesses buy and sell carbon allowances within predetermined emission caps, incentivizing the development and implementation of cleaner technologies. Both VCCs and carbon trading contribute to sustainable development by promoting environmental responsibility and providing financial incentives for emissions reduction projects, playing a crucial role in the transition to a carbon-neutral future.

            <strong>Using Machine Learning to Predict Adverse Drug Reactions</strong>
            (Aug 2023 – Nov 2023)<br>
            I conducted a review on how machine learning (ML) is being used to predict adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and improve drug safety and development. The study addresses challenges in predicting ADRs, such as handling diverse patient data and understanding complex biological systems, while also discussing the ethical concerns of using patient data for ML models. I explored various ML techniques for ADR prediction, including feature selection, classification models, and deep learning, and provided real-world examples to highlight both the strengths and limitations of these methods.

            <strong>Socio-Economic Factors That Impact Vaccination Decisions</strong>
            (May 2023 – July 2023)<br>
            During my summer internship in 2023, I conducted a study analyzing the socio-economic factors influencing vaccination decisions across different groups in India. The project focused on understanding how economic and social disparities contribute to varied vaccination rates, using M-Probit and regression models to analyze the data. The findings provided valuable insights for public health policymakers, highlighting areas where targeted interventions could help address these disparities and improve vaccination coverage, ultimately supporting more equitable health outcomes across socio-economic groups.

            <strong>Generating Random Point Cloud Scenes for Autonomous Driving</strong>
            (Jan 2023 – May 2023)<br>
            During this priject, I focused on the application of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, which uses laser light to measure distances and create 3D maps of surfaces. I explored how LiDAR is used in autonomous vehicles to enhance their ability to understand their surroundings, plan movement, and navigate safely. Recognizing the challenge of limited LiDAR data for training autonomous systems, I applied Genetic Algorithms to simulate various environments, providing more data for vehicles to learn from and contributing to the realization of safer autonomous driving technology. This project was done as part of my "Artifical Intelligence" course.

            <strong>Prediction of Stock Market Trends Using Machine Learning</strong>
            (Aug 2022 – Nov 2022)<br>
            During my project on stock market predictions, I explored various machine learning models and techniques for forecasting stock prices to aid traders in making informed decisions. I studied Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are effective for predicting time-series data, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), known for their strong performance as binary classifiers. For LSTM, I followed a series of steps, including data normalization, model creation with layers from Keras, and prediction plotting. For SVM, I utilized explanatory variables like "Open-Close" and "High-Low" to create the classifier model and predict strategy returns. I also explored simpler methods like Moving Average Time Series and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), while discussing the two key techniques for stock market analysis: fundamental analysis, which focuses on a company's intrinsic value, and technical analysis, which uses measurable data to capture stock market movement patterns.

            <strong>Analyzing the Healthcare System After Decentralization in Kerala</strong>
            (May 2022 – July 2022)<br>
            During my research internship in 2022, I analyzed Kerala's healthcare system after decentralization, using literature from the Center for Developmental Studies. Kerala, known for its high health development index despite a low per capita income, faced challenges in utilizing available health facilities, leading to the growth of an unregulated private sector and rising health expenditures. Decentralization aimed to address these issues by redistributing power to local institutions, enhancing the efficiency of health service delivery. I reviewed existing research and discussed the advantages of decentralization, contributing valuable insights into the impact of local governance on healthcare outcomes.

            <strong>Impact of Road Construction on Family Planning in India</strong>
            (Jun 2022 – Nov 2022)<br>
            Qualitative analysis on road construction and its impact on access to family planning services.<br>
            Studied how improved accessibility influences usage of family planning clinics and analyzed what could be implemented to better family planning.
